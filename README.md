# Java Pathfinding
This projet implements several pathfinding and graph algorithms in Java.
But the aim is to be language agnostic, If you're a JavaScript developer, you could understand the projet (at least, this is the goal). The main focus is to have a strong OO (oriented object) architecture! A rich documentation will be available soon explaining it.

## Why this projet?
Okay, we can find a lot of algorithms / library that does almost the same thing, so why do I reinvent the wheel?


I found a lot of articles / code talking about these algorithms. But, something annoys me a lot, that's the code quality and reusability, I couldn't find any good code on the Internet so I made mine.


## Status
I'm working on documentation. I want this project to be very accessible. All of my choices, my errors, difficulties will be written so my work can be used to study.
