## Goal
I found a lot of articles / code talking about these algorithms. But, something annoys me a lot, that's the code quality and reusability, I couldn't find any good code on the Internet so I made mine.

This project was initiated during my computer science class.

## Status
I'm working on documentation. I want this project to be very accessible. All of my choices, my errors, difficulties will be written so my work can be used to study.
